* Names
 - We are using the CamelCase naming convention. In C++, the first letter is
 capitalized for class names, whereas it is not for method names. Private
 attributes begin with an underscore followed by a lower case letter.
 Underscores are forbidden in class and method names.
- SWIG is used to generate Python bindings. It processes headers files to do
  its magic. Therefore the parameter names in headers are not meaningless.

* Documentation
We are using Doxygen to document the code. Please document a function or a
method before its signature. Doxygen uses '/**' and '*/' as delimiter.
- how to document function:

/** function to compare bar and fun
* \param bar an integer
* \param fun an integer
* \return 1 if fun > bar, 0 otherwise
*/
unsigned int foo(int bar, int fun);

for the parameter, you can also also specify the direction using [in], [out]
or [in, out]. Example:
/** function to copy and multiply by a scalar
* \param[in] x the input vector
* \param[out] y the output vector
* \param coeff the coefficient to apply
*/
void myaxpy(double * x, double * y, double coeff)

- how to document variables:
/** used to compute foo */
unsigned int bar;

- how to document a class:
provide a brief description:
/** \brief This class describe bar */

and a detailed one
/** This class is meant to ... blablabla ... */

document all the attributes and the functions
